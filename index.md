# About Me
Hello! I'm **Melody**, or Mel if you prefer. I'm a 4th year studying Machine Learning and double-minoring in Linguistics and Computer Science. 
I'm an avid (manga/light novel/webtoon) reader and enjoying trying new foods! In my free time, I also like to cook, watch anime and go biking.

Above is the main character from one of my favorite light novels, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken. Although the anime didn't do the manga justice, I included it because its main character is pretty cool and because my favorite monsters are slimes (which be influenced from my days playing Maplestory)! 
 
## Food Corner
I've been craving Japanese food recently and finally was able to eat nigiri this past weekend. My favorite 5 are:
1. maguro or ootoro
2. salmon
3. yellowtail
4. albacore
5. red snapper

I've also started a quest to perfect miso soup over the past weekend. Although I enjoy soft tofu, I've also discovered the dried, older tofu also works to give more texture, since the tofu's texture is similar to a sponge when aged. 

Meanwhile, my lifelong food goal is to perfect the omelette. Not the ones you get from Denny's, but the __perfect__, fluffiest, _simplest_ (in terms ingredients) one, like the ones made by the Master at Kichi Kichi in Kyoto, Japan (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu5zGHjRaMo&ab_channel=UmiSyam).

I love to eat eggs, in all shape or form (except raw!). This also is a large part as to why Gudetama (pictured here) is my favorite mascot. ~~it's definitely not because I relate to the laziness, no sir~~ In fact, I've trying to maximize the ways I can cook them. Here's my list so far: 
- [x] Sunny side up
- [x] Over easy
- [x] Steamed
- [x] Scrambled
- [x] Omelette
- [ ] Deviled Eggs
- [ ] Baked
- [x] Fried
- [x] Hard-boiled/soft-boiled

Fun facts: in 4th and 9th grade, my mom used to give me a single hard-boiled egg for breakfast/morning snack almost every day for class.

## My Programmer Side
I have some experience with languages like Python, Java and C++ and am currently learning Clojure (thanks LIGN165 :^D). My coding experience is limited mostly to data structure courses and machine learning algorithms, but recently I've been trying to delve more into front-end development. 

Some of my goals as a programmer include: 
- Getting to the point where I can go design, implement and prototype an app by myself
- Solving hard Leetcode problems in my sleep 
- To one day return to my high school and help them redesign their system and/or website

Whenever I get stuck on a bug on code, like my first ever one for example:   
``` Error: IndexOutOfBounds ```

I like to think of this quote, spoken by a wise bald man from One-Punch Man: 
> I'll leave tomorrow's problems to tomorrow's me. 
No I'm just ~~partly~~ kidding.
