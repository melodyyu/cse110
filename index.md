# About Me
Hello! I'm **Melody**, or Mel if you prefer. I'm a 4th year studying Machine Learning and double-minoring in Linguistics and Computer Science. 
I enjoy keeping updated with manga and trying new foods! In my free time, I also like to read light novels or webtoons, watch anime and go biking.

Above is the main character from one of my favorite light novels, Rimuru the slime. Although the anime didn't do the manga justice, I included it because my favorite monsters are slime (which be influenced from my days playing Maplestory). In the words of Rimuru: 
>I'm not a bad slime!
